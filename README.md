# 🧬 DNA Pattern Matcher (Java)
A simple Java console application that detects specific gene patterns in a DNA sequence using basic string-matching logic.
This project was built to apply core DSA concepts to a real-world inspired problem, without using frameworks or external libraries.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given:
- A DNA sequence
- A pattern (gene sequence)
The program:
- Validates whether the input is a valid DNA sequence
- Searches for all occurrences of the pattern
- Reports match positions
- Counts total matches
- Highlights mismatches during scanning

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- Java Strings
- Nested loops
- Sliding window technique
- Input validation

⏱️ Time Complexity
Worst-case time complexity is O(n × m)
n = length of DNA sequence
m = length of pattern
